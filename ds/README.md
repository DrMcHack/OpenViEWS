# Dynasim

## Getting started

The example is based on this directory existing in ~/github/Views/ds, if this isn't the case on your system you need to change the DIR_DS variable in example/run_example.sh

* Make sure you have miniconda installed. Get the latest one from https://conda.io/miniconda.html
* In your terminal change to this directory and run `bash install.sh`, it will install all the dependencies for you and create a dynasim directory in your home directory (~/dynasim)
* Run `bash example/run_example.sh`
* Voila!

The example is a simple case of statebased violence and protests interacting with time-series, spatial lags and transformations.
Example including linear models coming later.
